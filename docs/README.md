# Approach and conclusions so far

In this project we put to work all that we learned since the start of the course.

It uses a Postgres database and a Ruby server implementation to create, update, read and delete data. Sinatra offers the links to the client. 

- I started from designing the database and the tables, then the model and repository classes.
- I set up and installed the required tools in the project directory. 
- I created the database, estabilished the connection, created the seeds and seeded it.
- I proceeded creating tests alternating them with the implementation of the project.
